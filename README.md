# cheqd: Cosmos SDK Airdrop Frontend


## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

As part of our marketing initiatives at the start of 2022, we ran an airdrop to Cosmonauts, rewarding individuals for their participants in a range of activities, such as staking CHEQ, ATOM, OSMO and JUNO, and contributing to Liquidity Pools on Osmosis - [Pool 602](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/602) and [Pool 617](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/617)

In the airdrop we had 6 tiers that an individual wallet could be eligible to be rewarded in CHEQ for. As a result it made more sense for us to provide a page where individuals could check their eligibility and claim, rather than airdropping tokens directly to wallets. 

To do this we built a basic self-serve microsite using projects which had done something similar including [Likecoin](https://github.com/likecoin/app-like-co).  

We recommend looking at the [documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) for further information if you're interested in leveraging this repo.
